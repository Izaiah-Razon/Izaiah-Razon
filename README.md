- Hi, I'm Izaiah 👋
- I'm currently studying Computer Engineering.
- I chose my major because I enjoy problem-solving and building things.
- A fun fact about me is: I volunteer at robotics competitions.
- What do I want to learn from EE 205? I want to learn how to design programs using classes.
- A book or movie I'd recommend is: Atomic Habits by James Clear.
